      <h3>Hire Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <a href="aboutme.html">Julie Langmade</a> and I recently completed the Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript including jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, and React.
        I was able to land a great gig with Jarrell Systems based in Atlanta, GA where I'm using my <a href="skills.html">skills</a>. I'd love an opportunity to work with you to make
        beautiful and functional websites. Take a peek at my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> to see details of my pre-development life.

      <p>
        Life, like any story worth reading, contains chapters that help explain the narrative.  When I trace the chapters of my life, I see themes that led me to quit my comfortable job in publishing and to attend The Iron Yard an immersive code school. Most of my roles in the last several years have involved digital marketing and e-commerce, but, until now, I’ve lacked of technical skills to complement my marketing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new chapter of becoming a Front End Engineer has been challenging, frustrating, and unbelievably rewarding. Today I have the foundational skills I need to be a Front End Engineer.  Do I know everything I need to know?  Absolutely not but I’ve developed some impressive Google skills to help find the answers I need.  Learning to learn is the most valuable skill acquired at The Iron Yard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dream about using my background and my new skills to tell stories through beautiful, engaging, and interactive online environments. I understand business strategy and the role technology plays in a successful business.  When I catch the vision for a project, I believe I can help the team bring it to reality.
